- Express doesn't bundle any template engines
- But it supports 14+ NodeJS template engines

how often do we see web pages in plain text?

most apps we build usually should return html or json.

To keep thing simple, ExpressJS team decided not to support any specific template engines, so how do they support 14+ template engines.
