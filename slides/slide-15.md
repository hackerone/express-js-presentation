## Do I have to write everything myself?

<pre><code>
	
	npm install yo -g

	npm install generator-express -g

	yo express

	// and you'll have an app running in seconds!

</code></pre>

Note:
So, we saw a bunch of things about expressJS. most are essential for any web app. So, do i have to write everything myself? 
Luckily not, people have come up with Yeoman generator, which scaffolds the app with all the essentials including templates and database.

use them! but don't trust them blindly, read through the code they generate
