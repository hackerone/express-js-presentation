Note:
Before we jump into ExpressJS, let's take a look at what NodeJS is quickly, this will help us understand why expressJS helps.
NodeJS is a javascript runtime built on chrome's V8 javascript engine. It uses an event driven and non-blocking IO model which makes it lightweight and efficient. It also means that most of the operations are async and we'll be dealing with callbacks often.

It has a large package eco-system, npm. So, most libraries you'll need for building a web app are built by someone already.
